# So You Think You Can Code?

A quiz game application featuring all coding related questions.

## Description

This application is a Quiz Game Challenge against the clock! It features multiple choice questions on many topics of coding. Work your way through the questions. Selecting the correct answer will advance the player to the next question. You will be racing against the clock. Your score will be the time remaining on the countdown timer once the quiz is finished. 

I built this application so that people can not only test their knowledge of different aspects of codind but to also have fun while you learn! 

While designing this application I have learnt the importance of utilizing Client-Side Local Storage, the neccessity for clean, readable code and the importance of DOM manipulation. I look forward to designing and building future applications to aid learning for budding developers.
